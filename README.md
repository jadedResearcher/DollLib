# DollLib
hopefully everything you need to render a doll made by the maker

work in progress.

IMPORTANT: TO MAKE THIS WORK YOU NEED TO COPY AND PASTE THE MANIFEST DIRECTORY UP TO THE SAME LEVEL AS THE CSS FOLDER. PL SAYS SO.
ALSO COPY AND PASTE THE IMAGES FOLDER INTO THE SAME LEVEL AS THE CSS DIRECTORY. IF IT ALREADY EXISTS, THEN JUST THE CONTENTS.
MAKE A CSS FOLDER IF NEEDED. CSS FOLDER SHOULD BE ON SAME LEVEL AS SCRIPTS FOLDER.
